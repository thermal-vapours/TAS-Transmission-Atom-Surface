TAS - Transmission spectra with Atom-Surface interactions
=========================================================

A Python package for generating transmission spectra through
optically thin slabs of atomic vapours contained in
spectroscopic cells of thickness < λ/(2π), where
atom-surface van der Waals interaction induces level shifts.
Generated  spectra can be used for fitting results
of atom-vapour laser spectroscopy to obtain strength of
atom-surface interactions.

For more details on problem statement, solution method,
assumptions and general use of package
[see documentation](https://tas-transmission-atom-surface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For example of use of generated spectra to obtain
van der Waals interaction coefficient between alkali
atoms and sapphire surface, see paper.
Example of using data from paper and fitting procedure
to obtain van der Waals interaction coefficient
is provided in example notebook.
